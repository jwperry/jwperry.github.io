<p>Having reached the end of module two at Turing, one of the most interesting challenges to overcome has been learning how to function as part of a team that is attempting to solve complex programming challenges. While teamwork itself has been a major requirement for success in past jobs, this is the first time I've collaborated so thoroughly in such a creative and logic-heavy environment. It has come with its own set of challenges and rewards, and has proven to be a very enriching experience.</p>

<p>During module one, we had our introduction to group coding with simple pairing exercises, and a few short projects. Working in a pair is a fairly natural transition as we tended to work together on the majority of the code base. Having only two developers present makes communication very easy, and requires both developers to be actively contributing as it's very easy to measure individual contribution. Overall, my pairing experiences were extremely positive, and my teams achieved strong group synergy in both our HTTP and Headcount projects.</p>

<p>In module two, we graduated to work in three and then four person development teams. The increased team size definitely quickly increased the difficulty of maintaining proper communication and group dynamics. Both my TrafficSpy and LittleShop groups quickly took the time to DTR (Define the Relationship) and establish solid practices, procedures, and norms for group work. Working in groups of this size also helped us to cement our understanding of team practices for managing remote code repositories on GitHub. Working in a team of four particularly brought a number of challenges related to differing expectations and visions for our project from each group member, but through strong communication and cooperation with each other, we were able to function well as a unit.</p>

<p>At this point, I'm very excited to see what the next two modules at Turing will hold for me. Having the opportunity to expand the roster of people with whom I've joined on projects is an exciting prospect, and I find myself eager to tackle more challenging projects with more of my peers.</p>
